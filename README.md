Install warc via pip, preferably after activating a virtualenv.
Copy the files in this repo in ~nameofvirtualenv/bin/python/site-packages replacing the one installed via pip.
Thats it the plugin is installed. 
Now when you read an arc file python will use the patched warc package and process the retrieved data.
